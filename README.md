# YMDB - Your Movie Database

**YMDB** is a cinephile hobbyist site for people that love making lists, film discussion, and film exploration.

The site is meant to be a minimalist competitor to sites like Mubi and Letterboxd that appeals to a nerdier audience and that is specifically tailored towards list making and film discussion.  The site will have well-thought out limitations that make users more deliberate in how they chose films for their one and only list, which they can name and describe in the description section however they like.  The site will encourage users to make a list of favorite films, not themed or best-of-decade lists and there will be a YMDB top films lists that aggragates film rankings from all user lists to make an overall YMDB community ranking, similar to what rateyourmusic.com has.  

## Build Tools

YMDB is a full stack website built with React and Redux on the front-end, MongoDB and Express for the back-end.

## Project Start Commands

Front-end: ```npm start```

Server: ```npm run server```

## Current State

The site is still very much under construction, though if you click on the hardcoded username "kesto" near the top right, it will take you to a profile page.  On this page, all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions are on full display.

## Future Goals

* Build authentication and user sign up soon, with the use of JSON web tokens.
* Have more movie data visible like director in the search results
* Allow for more than 10 search results to display at a time, with a scroll feature
* Make a button that allows switching between a more polished/published list view and an edit view
* Make site mobile-friendly and fully responsive
* Improve styling and overall user experience.  
* Create Home page that has a section for lists ranked by their popularity and a section for top movies according to aggragated YMDB user rankings.  
* Add pictures of website to this repo README.md.
