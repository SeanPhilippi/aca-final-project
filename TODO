Heroku deployment:
$ git push heroku master

Vision:
- minimalist cinephile site
- similar to reddit, old ymdb, and rateyourmusic, site for nerds that like lists and data
- primary focus is to have one list of up to 20 films per user, encourages 'favorite of
all time' lists
- comments column on individuals lists
- movie pages also have comment sections
- movie pages show rank on user lists and an overall site ranking
- movie pages have imdb link
- create account and login pages, need unique username, can't be changed, unique email
required
- user lists have description section that allows for many characters, users can get
create with how they utilize it
- home page for site would have ranking of top movies according to ymdb users
- home page would have ranking of most frequented user lists


To do list:
- fix Registration, new users are posting but history.push('/login') doesn't work, study react-router-dom and history module
- set up routing for movie pages
- fix hyperlink colors on sortablelist, visited gold, neutral black?
- build movie page boiler plate (look at mockup!)
- fix list styling, 20 movies viewable in screen with room to spare
- visual signifiers or notification message or displayed count so movies can't be added after 20 cap
- look at and fix updateStatus()
- make movies added to list persist by storing in localStorage upon add/reorder, or by PUT request to mongodb for any change
- /profile is still reachable when user is logged out, why?  Also logging out while on /profile does not redirect user to /login, why?
  - read about and understand how history api works
- incorporate Stu's http api and do some clean up in actions.js
- import icons
- add YMDB logo graphic in place of 'Home' nav link
- make new mlab collections, movies and comments
- set up global styling root colors and variables
- work on edit/presentation view
- Layout.js and Card.js wrapper components
- update README and upload pics on Portfolio
- add to beginning/end toggle button
- no duplicate usernames, make an error message for it and put in register validation function
- pass userData into NewRegisters component
- give users a register_date and last_login date
- allow for emojis when making comments
- fix white gradient, make it more prominent/work.  Currently doing nothing?
- make profiles
- make actions (setList, orderList, deleteMovie) also save the updates to mlab automatically
- make site mobile friendly / responsive
- make button to switch between list view and edit view.  dragging, editing description, etc, only
  functional in edit view
- add director info in search results!  **warning** pain in the ass
- how to put a cap of 20 movies for list?
- display highlighted, annimated drop down banner 'List updated' whenever user clicks outside
  an editing box or a change in state.list is detected.
- look at Steven Fiero's github and copy his readme.MD formatting, create a comprehensive README.MD
- long movie titles cause text to bleed out of element, fix css
- improve UX for site and build out README so it is easy to know how to use it.
- responsive design - change px to rem throughout app, I have root px being changed via media query in index.css

Left off:

- make names of newUsers and users in users'index clickable, directing to /profile/${username} and fetching their list and statement for a presentation list pag
