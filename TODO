Heroku deployment:
$ git push heroku master

Vision:
- minimalist cinephile site
- similar to reddit, old ymdb, and rateyourmusic, site for nerds that like lists and data
- primary focus is to have one list of up to 20 films per user, encourages 'favorite of
all time' lists
- comments column on individuals lists
- movie pages also have comment sections
- movie pages show rank on user lists and an overall site ranking
- movie pages have imdb link
- create account and login pages, need unique username, can't be changed, unique email
required
- user lists have description section that allows for many characters, users can get
create with how they utilize it
- home page for site would have ranking of top movies according to ymdb users
- home page would have ranking of most frequented user lists

To do list:
- be able to visit a Profile from clicking on username in comment, list currently doesn't load properly
- movies transferring to other profiles when you click on their name in comment sometimes, why??
- stop comments from transferring to movie pages
- should I collapse ViewableList and SortableList?  They share a lot of the same code.  Profile has a lot of conditional logic already to create different views, should
  SortableList just render ViewableItem vs SortableItem?
- add a blurb field to ListModel, limit it to 20 characters or something
- make RegisterBox and LoginBox look way more alike, lots of styling differences
- create another substantial card component and populate with dummy data
- add pictures and expand on technologies used for project in README
- make nav box tiles taller
- fire and floppy icons for save and delete buttons
- populate the rest of the lists, even if it's gibberish.  need this site to have an illussion of activity and a good user experience.
- fix ellipsis, fixed width is too wide and not responsive, it's bleeding out of element already
- set a class on class 'count', fading red text upon trying to add more than 20 movies
- do I need state.editing?  other ways to use it.  make sure use is authenticated so they can't edit other lists
- finish account page, make an MVP
  - https://toolset.com/documentation/user-guides/building-the-my-account-page/
- fix hyperlink colors
- "Are you sure you want to discard your changes?"  <discard> <keep editing> pop up when user tries to leave SortableList
- scrape IMDB urls, look into other apis or scraping tools
- make some basic tests using Jest.  Start up my app and do a simple flow with a dummy accont and make sure everything runs
  smoothly, then just run with a script or have it run everytime I push up or something.  I want to treat this site like it's
  legit.
