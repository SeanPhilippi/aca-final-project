Heroku deployment:
$ git push heroku master

Vision:
- minimalist cinephile site
- similar to reddit, old ymdb, and rateyourmusic, site for nerds that like lists and data
- primary focus is to have one list of up to 20 films per user, encourages 'favorite of
all time' lists
- comments column on individuals lists
- movie pages also have comment sections
- movie pages show rank on user lists and an overall site ranking
- movie pages have imdb link
- create account and login pages, need unique username, can't be changed, unique email
required
- user lists have description section that allows for many characters, users can get
create with how they utilize it
- home page for site would have ranking of top movies according to ymdb users
- home page would have ranking of most frequented user lists

To do list:
- work on edit/presentation view
- fix history, so history.push works.  might have to deal with react-router-dom v4
  - look into creating history.js and swapping BrowserRouter with Router wrapper

- new registers keep disappearing!?
- finish account page, make an MVP
  - https://toolset.com/documentation/user-guides/building-the-my-account-page/
- "Are you sure you want to discard your changes?"  <discard> <keep editing> pop up when user tries to leave SortableList
- scrape IMDB urls, look into other apis or scraping tools
- improve styling of Nav, make nav links look like animated buttons
- find fontAwesome icons or other icons to put into header components for cards!!
- change all links to styled buttons
- was able to add 3 of the same movie, not good...
- use CLEAR_ERRORS action when visiting any component that has login or registerbox visible, look into history.listen()
- fix hyperlink visited/neutral color, might have to store data in localStorage?
- make white background width of the container on home page
- /profile is still reachable when user is logged out, why?  Also logging out while on /profile does not redirect user to /login, why?
  - read about and understand how history api works
- create another substantial card component and populate with dummy data
- make the delete lightbox on brand
- make some tests for site using Jest or Selenium
- make a global button class.  most buttons should look roughly the same...
- display next to save/delete list buttons the number of movies in user list, and display a message when their list is full
- look into emailing a password reset link
- allow login with username OR email, currently only email which isn't intuitive
- adjust fontsize to Mead way, so I can have more granularity while sticking with rems
- incorporate Stu's http api and do some clean up in actions.js
- **how to collect visitor count for user lists, need to do that ASAP so I can populate home page with most visited lists
- fix list styling, 20 movies viewable in screen with room to spare
- visual signifiers or notification message or displayed count so movies can't be added after 20 cap
- look at and fix updateStatus()
- make movies added to list persist by storing in localStorage upon add/reorder, or by PUT request to mongodb for any change
- add YMDB logo graphic in place of 'Home' nav link
- set up global styling root colors and variables
- update README and add pics of site
- add to beginning/end toggle button
- make errors clear upon navigating to a new page so they don't transfer to another element on page that renders from errors object
- give users a register_date and last_login date
- allow for emojis when making comments
- fix white gradient, make it more prominent/work.  Currently doing nothing?
- make actions (setList, orderList, deleteMovie) also save the updates to mlab automatically
- make site mobile friendly / responsive
- make button to switch between list view and edit view.  dragging, editing description, etc, only
  functional in edit view
- add director info in search results!  **warning** pain in the ass
- how to put a cap of 20 movies for list?
- display highlighted, annimated drop down banner 'List updated' whenever user clicks outside
  an editing box or a change in state.list is detected.
- look at Steven Fiero's github and copy his readme.MD formatting, create a comprehensive README.MD
- long movie titles cause text to bleed out of element, fix css
- improve UX for site and build out README so it is easy to know how to use it.
- responsive design - change px to rem throughout app, I have root px being changed via media query in index.css

Left off:

- make names of newUsers and users in users'index clickable, directing to /profile/${username} and fetching their list and statement for a presentation list pag
