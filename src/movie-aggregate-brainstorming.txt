Vision:
- overall ranking
- number of points
- number of users that ranked this movie
- average ranking in the user's list

Plan:
- find all List docs with movie id in items array
- grab those movies and get the index, + 1, and grab the username
- project those back, have an array of objects containing rank (index of movie + 1) and username
- map these objects into a list of usernames that link to their list and the movie ranking
