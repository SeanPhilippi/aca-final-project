- put any images in public folder and link like this: src="image.png", don't use urls that could change

- try to redesign all functions so they manipulte the state.results in App.js.  
- link DraggableList's list to state.list
- put ${} values into DraggableList and fetch from api to fill those values
- create fetch function with PUT method to update/add to an exist list and excute this function within
an onClick event on searchResult component


- fetch('/list') is not fetching from my '/list' GET route from my backend... 
I think it is looking at Port 3000, which is my front end.  how to fix... 

- might be a CORS issue?
