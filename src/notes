- put any images in public folder and link like this: src="image.png", don't use urls that could change

- try to redesign all functions so they manipulte the state.results in App.js.  
- link DraggableList's list to state.list
- put ${} values into DraggableList and fetch from api to fill those values
- create fetch function with PUT method to update/add to an exist list and excute this function within
an onClick event on searchResult component


- put all functions that use setState into App.js and pass down, and have one state 

- work on handleAdd so clicking on a search result will add 
that movie to state.list and render in DraggableList

- do fetch call within handleAdd that fetches that movie from omdb api by id and returns data that has 'director' value
I can access for injecting into my movie object to put into state.list

- incorporate PropTypes into my project
- add delete button to list items

-reorganize project using Redux!!! rendering issue is a promise delay issue

-watch a few videos on Thunk to understand it

-- finish last 10 min or so of Traversy posts project

-- where I left off: lots of boilerplate for Redux is in place, now how to 
convert my current functions to Redux actions...
